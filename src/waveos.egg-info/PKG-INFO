Here’s a **clean, founder-grade README** you can drop straight into the repo.
 It explains **what Wave OS is today**, **why it exists**, and **what it becomes**—without overhyping or locking you into claims you haven’t built yet.

 # 🌊 Wave OS
 
 **The intelligence layer for optical, energy-aware networks**
 
 Wave OS is a vendor-neutral **Optical OS / Network Brain** that turns optical links and photonic fabrics from *passive transport pipes* into **adaptive, self-healing, energy-aware systems**.
 
 Modern networks can move photons at incredible speed—but they don’t **reason**.
 Wave OS adds that missing intelligence layer.
 
 ---
 
 ## Why Wave OS Exists
 
 Today’s optical and high-speed networks:
 
 * Carry data, but don’t understand **risk**
 * Report telemetry, but don’t **act on it**
 * React to failures after the fact
 * Ignore **energy, thermal, and degradation constraints**
 * Treat routing, power, and workload priority as separate problems
 
 As compute scales (AI clusters, defense systems, edge compute), these gaps become systemic failures.
 
 **Wave OS exists to reason across them.**
 
 ---
 
 ## What Wave OS Is (V1)
 
 Wave OS is a **software control plane** that sits above optical and network infrastructure and provides:
 
 ### Core Capabilities
 
 * **Telemetry ingestion**
 
   * Optical and port metrics (errors, drops, retries)
   * FEC and BER proxies
   * Optics diagnostics (TX/RX power, temperature)
 * **Normalization**
 
   * Vendor-neutral data model for links, ports, paths, and workloads
 * **Health & drift detection**
 
   * Baseline vs run comparison
   * PASS / WARN / FAIL classification
   * Root-cause drivers
 * **Policy reasoning**
 
   * Uses health, drift, workload priority, and energy constraints
   * Produces recommended actions (advisory in V1)
 * **Closed-loop simulation**
 
   * Fault injection (errors, congestion, thermal drift)
   * Demonstrates autonomous reasoning
 * **Explainable reporting**
 
   * Human-readable HTML reports
   * Machine-readable JSON artifacts
   * Event timelines showing *what degraded, why, and what Wave OS decided*
 
 Wave OS **does not replace switches, NICs, or optics**.
 It makes them *intelligent as a system*.

 ## What Wave OS Is Not
 
 * Not a hardware product
 * Not a proprietary networking stack
 * Not tied to a single vendor
 * Not a replacement for existing control planes
 
 Wave OS is **the reasoning layer above them**.

 ## Architecture (High Level)
 
 ```
 Telemetry Sources
   ↓
 Collectors (file, gNMI stubs)
   ↓
 Normalization Layer
   ↓
 Health & Drift Scoring
   ↓
 Policy Engine (Network Brain)
   ↓

 Reports & Events
 ```
 
 Design principles:
 
 * Vendor neutrality
 * Modular components
 * Explainable decisions
 * Local-first execution
 * Simulation before actuation
 
 ---
 
 ## Current Status (V1)
 
 Wave OS currently provides:
 
 * End-to-end local demo
 * Simulated optical/network telemetry
 * Health scoring and drift detection
 * Policy recommendations
 * Fault-injection scenarios
 * CLI + HTML reports
 
 V1 is focused on **proving closed-loop intelligence**, not controlling production hardware yet.

 ## What We Believe Wave OS Can Become
 
 Wave OS is designed as a **foundational platform**, not a single product.
 Below is the long-term vision.
 
 ---
 
 ### 🔹 V2 – Energy-Aware Network Intelligence
 
 Wave OS incorporates power and thermal constraints directly into routing and scheduling decisions.
 
 **Enables:**
 
 * Power-budgeted optical fabrics
 * Energy-aware workload placement
 * Predictive congestion avoidance
 * Reduced overprovisioning
 
 ---
 
 ### 🔹 V3 – Optical Fabric Governance
 
 Wave OS reasons about networks as **economic and risk systems**, not just technical ones.
 
 **Enables:**
 
 * Priority-based optical path allocation
 * Risk-weighted routing decisions
 * Internal cost and efficiency optimization
 * Fabric-level SLA enforcement
 
 ---
 
 ### 🔹 V4 – Autonomous Infrastructure Control
 
 Wave OS coordinates across systems, not just links.
 
 **Enables:**
 
 * Multi-site self-healing networks
 * Hybrid optical + RF routing
 * Autonomous degradation isolation
 * Minimal human intervention
 
 ---
 
 ### 🔹 Long-Term Vision – Infrastructure Cognition
 
 Wave OS evolves into a **general intelligence layer for physical infrastructure**.
 
 **Potential domains:**
 
 * AI data centers
 * Defense compute systems
 * Edge and embedded systems
 * Energy-constrained environments
 * Space and remote infrastructure
 
 At this stage, networks don’t just move data—they **justify decisions** in terms of performance, energy, risk, and reliability.
 
 ---
 
 ## Why This Matters
 
 As infrastructure becomes more complex, **human-driven control does not scale**.
 
 Wave OS enables:
 
 * Predictable performance
 * Safer operation under constraints
 * Better utilization of expensive infrastructure
 * Trustable, explainable system behavior
 
 This is not about speed.
 It’s about **intelligence, stability, and governance**.
 
 ---
 
 ## Project Philosophy
 
 Wave OS is built on the belief that:
 
 > Infrastructure should understand itself well enough to protect itself—and explain why.

 If you want next, I can:
 
 * Tighten this into an **investor/partner README**
 * Add a **“Why Now”** section for NVIDIA / defense / AI clusters
 * Or generate the **ARCHITECTURE.md** that pairs with this cleanly
 
 Just tell me.
